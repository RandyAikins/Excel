# FustureTale Hotel Reservation Case Study

## Project Problem
FutureTale Hotel is having reservation challenges because significant reservation cancelation and causing revenue loss.

## Action
1. Checked for duplicates using the remove duplicate function
2. Filtered columns to check inconsistency in data
3. Used the sum function find Total Nights
4. Multiplied Total Night by Average Price to find revenue
5. Use If function to seperate revenue into Revenue received and Revenue lost
6. Use If function to convert months in numbers into string
7. Grouped Lead Time into Normal (<= 30 days), Long (<= 60 days) and Prolong (> 60 days) 
8. Pivot Tables are created to analyze dataset
9. Pivot Charts are generated from the Pivot Tables
10. Dashboard creation to visualize analysis
11. Slicers are inserted to filter dashboard charts

## Finding
- 357% increment inreservation with cancellation increament of 1,037% between 2017 and 2018
- $4.2 loss in revenue due to reservation cancellation
- 64% of reservation is made via online channel contributing to more than half of revenue
- Lead time lenght can predict the likehood of reservation cancellation
- Reservations peak in October with 5,317 bookings
- Room_Type 1 is the choicest room with 78% booking

## Recommedation
- Penalties should be introduced to curb long lead time hence reducing revenue loss
- Re-evalaluate services provided by other room types other than Room_Type 1 to increase revenue
- Promote other reservation channels with add-in to boost bookings and revenue
- Effective management between peak and off-peak months to control cost
